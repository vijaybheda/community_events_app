    "Firestore-backed data models for users and events with realtime synchronization.",
    "Navigation and routing implemented using GetX with named routes and bindings.",
    "Multi-language support with dynamic switching and RTL/LTR layouts."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User starts at Splash Screen; app checks authentication state and navigates to Login or Home accordingly.",
    "On Login screen, user authenticates via Google Sign-In; upon success, navigated to Home screen.",
    "On Home screen, user views all events with tabs (All Events, My RSVP, Past Events), utilizes search and filter, and selects events to view details.",
    "From Event Details, user can RSVP, share event, view attendees, or for creators, edit or delete event.",
    "Users can add a new event via Add Event screen with form inputs and image upload, or edit existing events if creator.",
    "My RSVPs screen shows events user committed to with option to revoke RSVP or view detail.",
    "Profile screen allows viewing and managing user info, logging out, and adjusting app settings.",
    "About/Help screen provides static info, FAQs, and contact options."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All user interactions (login, RSVP, add/edit/delete events) must update UI instantly and reflect in Firestore correctly.",
    "Authentication must function reliably using Google Sign-In with Firebase Auth and maintain session state.",
    "Event forms must perform validation on required fields and prevent submission of invalid data.",
    "Only event creators may edit or delete their events; unauthorized attempts should be blocked with error feedback.",
    "App must gracefully handle errors like network failures or permission denials, showing appropriate SnackBar/toast messages.",
    "Localization and language switching must update UI text and layout direction dynamically without restart.",
    "Pull-to-refresh on event lists must fetch latest data from Firestore and update UI.",
    "Image uploads for events should be stored in Firebase Storage and display thumbnails in event cards/details.",
    "Navigation routes must enforce access controls and pass required parameters (e.g., event IDs) correctly.",
    "UI must remain responsive and performant across mobile and web platforms with consistent theming and design using GetWidget components."
